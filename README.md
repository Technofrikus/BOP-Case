### About the BOP

[The BOP](https://github.com/blewis308/BOP-Keyboard) is a 6x20 ortholinear keyboard made by [fruitykeeb](https://www.fruitykeeb.xyz). The GB ran in May 2021. They keyboard itself is made with an FR4-Bottom-Plate and Standoffs. But I wanted a "real" case for it.

This case is designed to be as flat as possible, to reduce height of the keyboard for better typing. The bottom plate and the standoffs have to be removed. Only the top plate and PCB are used.

### Features of the case
- Gasket mounted
- split in the middle, so can be printed on normal sized printes (biggest part is 208x136mm)
- Typing angles: -6, 0, 6 degrees
- High profile, no floating keycaps

## Hardware needed
- Printed Case (obviously)
- 10x (+4x) M3x5,7mm Heat-Set Inserts for Plastic [(like this)](https://www.mcmaster.com/threaded-inserts/heat-set-inserts-for-plastic-7/thread-type~metric/)
- If you want the keyboard at an angle, you need 4 pcs inserts extra for the feet
- 10x (+4x) M3x20 button head screws (ISO 7380 or similar. But not ISO 4762, they are too tall!) 
- 2mm EPDM foam or similar for the gaskets
- some glue for the gaskets
- scissors for cutting the gaskets
- Soldering iron for putting in the inserts
